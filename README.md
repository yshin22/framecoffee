Framecoffee.net

Project Descriptoion:

    A Full Stack e-commerce website made using the MERN stack.
    
    Built for a local specialty coffee shop looking to expand their coffee beans to the online market.
    Developed with the user in mind, the website follows a minimalistic design that is visually pleasing while being
    functional. Scroll animations and big, bold fonts are some key elements that keep users engaged and easily explore
    the website.

    Content management was emphasized. Giving the admin autonomy from the developer when wanting to edit website content. 
    Which is why a series of tools were made, accessible by the admin to perform CRUD operations independently.

Features include: 

    Reactive scroll animations, Live Instagram feed, Contact page for whole sale collaboration, Dynamic art gallery, Admin tools,
    User Accounts, Shopping cart, Dynamic Shipping Calculations, etc.

Technologies:

    The MERN stack was used, not just for being a widely popular tech stack for building dynamic applications, but for its
    flexibility and scalability.
  
    Full Stack JavaScript:
  
    Being able to use JavaScript in both the Front End (React), Back End (Node), and Database (MongoDB) helped streamline the coding experience.
